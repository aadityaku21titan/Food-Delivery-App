// inline styles is not a preferred way to write in code for styling

// * prop -> is Just a JS Object

// * Note: When you have to dynamically pass in a data to a component, you pass in prop

// * Note We can also destructure props on the fly by wrapping them in between {}, this is like...

// * What is Config-driven-UI -> A "config-driven UI" is a user interface that is built and configured using a declarative configuration file or data structure, rather than being hardcoded.
// * Every company now-a-days follows these approach, because our Applications need to be Dynamic These Days
// * Note: A Good Senior Frontend engineer is - who is a good UI Layer Engineer and a good Data Layer Engineer
// * Why should we provide key property to the child elements - When creating a list in the UI from an array with JSX, you should add a key prop to each child and to any of its' children. React uses the key prop create a relationship between the component and the DOM element.
// The library uses this relationship to determine whether or not the component should be re-rendered.
